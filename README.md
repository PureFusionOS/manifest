The PureNexus Project
=====================

Getting Started
---------------

To build PureNexus from source, you'll need to be familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).


To initialize your local repository, use this command:

	repo init -u https://github.com/PureNexusProject-Mod/manifest.git -b n-mr2

Then to sync source, use this command:

	repo sync

After syncing is done, use these commands to build:

    1.) . build/envsetup.sh
    2.) brunch device-user/userdebug/eng

Enjoy, Stick around for a while AOSP Building is Fun!!!
